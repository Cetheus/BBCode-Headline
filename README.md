BBCode-Headline
===============

Headline BBCode for Woltlab Community Framework 2.x

This BBCode allows you to add more Structure to your Postings by using Headlines.

It's pretty simple to use:

[headline]I am a Headline[/headline]

Since Version 1.0.1 it is also possible to add an Anchor to your Headline:

[headline='anchor']I am a Headline with an Anchor[/headline]
